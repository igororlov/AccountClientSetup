AccountClientSetup
==================

WiX Installer example

Windows installer project for an AccountClient project (ODP assignment 2). 
Creates an installation folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\ with 2 folder versions C# and Java.
For each of them I created its own ComponentGroup that contains components - files specific for C# and for Java.

The result of build is .msi installer.
